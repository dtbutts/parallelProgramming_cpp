# Program #3

Name: Dawson Butts

How to compile all four programs:
  problem1 - 
  
    g++ -o runProb1 problem1.cpp -pthread
    ./runProb1
    
  problem2 - this program accepts <int> input for number of servings 'M' in the pot
             but it will default to 8 if no input is given
  
    g++ -o runProb2 problem2.cpp -pthread
    ./runProb2 20
    
  problem3 - this program accepts two <int> input for number of males & females
             but it will default to 1 and 1 if no input is given
  
    g++ -o runProb3 problem3.cpp -pthread
    ./runProb3 5 70
  
  problem4 - 
  
    g++ -o runProb4 problem4.cpp -pthread
    ./runProb4
